Hello everyone  Does anyone know how to fill out etotals We never got emails with instructions on how to use it Thank you   Cyber Ducks Teammother_ducker 
Poughkeepsie NY does anybody know where were supposed to go for the Hackathon on Monday 
where did you hear theres a hackathon this monday 
where did you learn about it 
Is there a schedule of these sessions so we can plan accordingly 
Is the link going to be the same as last Thursdays for the Executive Speaker Series today at 2 pm 
Is there a link for todays speaker session 
W47S639CK W47U95FL0 Lots of questions on this  Can you post an up to date speaker series schedule in this channel as well as the intern channels  If there are changes or cancellations can that schedule be re posted or the channels alerted  Thanks  
Can we also have a schedule of important dates and events for the summer Im not sure what its like at the locations where there are large groups of interns but Im the only one at my location so information feels sparse 
Where did you get that 
When is the intern finale 
WHUTDH7HQ   httpscalendarhaifaibmcomhomecalendarId28458 
i think the dates are july 22 24th this is according to the intern timeline from orientation 
what is the intern finale 
WHUTDH7HQ Are we sure this timeline is accurate I am seeing different dates for the hack a thon This link shows it being July 10th but the program Timeline shows it being July 15th   httpsw3ibmcomw3publisherna intern hackathon 
Anyone know how the bus too the domain works exactly 
If possible could someone pinpost the timeline I took a picture of it the first day but lost all my photos 
This probably makes more sense to post in the Austin specific channel so others there will see the info I think the domain is in Austin right 
Quick question if your manager doesnt sign your e totals do you still get paid 
It might be labelled incorrectly as not signed when it actually is 
WKEB67UJ0 WK3CSUXUK this channel is a community of all interns developers offering managers and designers who are with us from multiple locations across IBM nUse this for a networking tool information sharing platform and people watching reading experience slightly_smiling_face

What  When is Intern to a Job 
forward me the email 
W47U95FL0 Since the finale is more of a celebration now will other interns still be flying in to Austin and RTP 
The email was sent to 46 interns but I dont see you guys in the list You may have not received it yet 
what does it mean to be a multi workspace channel 
maybe check with someone in charge of the interns in your location about this session its called Turning Your Intern to a Job Workshop Learn the things required to do to be on top of your game Should we expect a direct deposit this week 
Anybody else receive a lump sum payment 
curious for the thumbs uppers   were you 520 starts 
If we are 520 starters and didnt receive any email or direct deposit what does that mean I got the email earlier in the week saying I would get my lump sum friday by direct deposit but neither that nor my regular check went in 
is lump sum payment direct deposit or paycheck 
for those who did not receive the lump sum did your manager sign your etotals 
and you set up direct deposit on workday thats really weird have you received any other checks 
it doesnt show a payment election of type DIRECT DEPOSIT WJU934XPE 
If you look in the top left of workday is there any not taken care of in you inbox or notifications under notifcations or inbox 
WJYBGM52S when do you normal receive the physical checks 
who is hr 
those of you who have received direct deposit payments  what time did you get them 
today 
Yep I didnt fill it out because Im an intern I wont have any business expenses And why would not filling that out impact my other channels of payment Im just annoyed a little 
Did you tell your manager 
What do you mean by sign up for it 
WAVM3UYGN How is it possible to not put in the routing number when its a required field Youre talking about Workday right 
what do we do if etotals still does not work for me 
Can you access Workday 
So you got your first checked paid on 531 no check on 67  
What do I do if I cant access anything related to w3 or the macibm app store or vpn I cant access the help chatbot because you have to be on w3 to do so and helpibm had me on hold for like six hours yesterday so I am really not sure where to go from here  
Do you have a think desk at your location I went there and they were able to help fairly quickly 
Were your credentials working prior and now they are not  
Can you run ethernet on a macbook pro 
So I got that email saying I would get my relocation stipend two days ago and havent gotten direct deposit or the stipend yet today My DD page on workday says completed Anyone know why this is happening Incredibly frustrating 
Thats frustrating Just an fyi I did get my relocation stipend just today so maybe its taking a bit to process 
Where do you check your direct deposit on Workday 
WAU7N5ETB when did you receive your lump Through DD or mailed paycheck 
gt Anyone know why this is happening Incredibly frustratingnnIt could just be because just in general in the US bank transfers take a long time 3 5 business daysnnThe technical reasons for why they take 3 5 business days are pretty interesting httpswwwnprorgsectionsmoney20131004229224964episode 489 the invisible plumbing of our economy Is the time entered in eTotals supposed to show up in the Time on Workday 
Is there any way to check where or if your paycheck has been sent yet I switched addresses recently and want to check what address that it was sent to or if it was sent at all 
When I set up DD I didnot  cover the Expense section since I tot there would be none  Is this an issue 
Do you have a link to the live chat 
So does each individual need to contact HR on their own or are they looking to fix it for everyone 
WJXPK1AJ3 was the relocation stipend included in the physical check that is being sent to you 
My banks shows up in the direct deposit do we still need contact them Everyone is really confused about the process and HR are not very helpful 
I contacted them a few days ago and they sent me an email that my DD would take effect 0630 Does this mean that i have to wait till then for my housing stipend 
WJV4V6Q21 do you know if our stipend will be on this check as well They told me it would be coming in today but idk sweat_smile
